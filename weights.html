    <!-- Bench Press -->
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Bench Press</h2>
        <p>You can use either two
            dumbbells, a barbell, or a smith machine to do your deadlifts. A flat bench is
            also required to get started with this exercise. If it's ever your first time doing bench presses, it is
            best to have a spotter with you if you ever begin to struggle.</p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Lay yourself on a flat bench and grip the bar near shoulder width.</li>
            <li>Lift the barbell off the rack.</li>
            <li>Slowly lower the barbell above your chest with your arms slightly angled outward.</li>
            <li>Then push up and away from your chest. Completing one rep.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <i>It's advised to start with lighter weights first. If the exercise becomes too
                easy, then
                add a few weights for difficulty.</i></p>

    <!-- Deadlifts -->
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Deadlifts</h2>
        <p>Deadlifts can exercise multiple muscle groups in your lower body if you keep a perfect form throughout your
            reps. Since the number of repetitions are low, the amount of sets you'll be doing is more than usual.
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>The barbell should be near your shins, and your feet planted on the floor not to wide.</li>
            <li>Bend down and grasp the barbell as if you were in a squat position.</li>
            <li>Pull the bar up with your arms extended, bringing the barbell against your upper thighs.</li>
            <li>With your back straight, bend down and slowly place the barbell on the floor.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <i>Keeping your back straight is very important, as you don't want your lower back to
                be doing all the lifting.</i></p>

        <p>This exercise requires a bench for you to rest your back on.

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Lean your upper back on the edge of the bench while bending near the floor.</li>
            <li>The barbell should be resting on your hips and your hands holding onto the sides of the bar for
                stability.</li>
            <li>Push your hips with the barbell upward, making your body parallel to the floor.</li>
            <li>Next lower your hips along with the bar back down near the floor.</li>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <i>Your shoulder blades should be resting on the bench and not your whole back.</i>

    <!-- Bulgarian Split Squats -->
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Bulgarian Split Squats</h2>
        <p>You'll need a pair of dumbbells and a flat bench to elevate your foot behind you. Switch your feet after
            completing your reps on each leg.

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Start by standing in front of a bench with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>

            <li>Then lower yourself down while bending your left knee.</li>
            <li>Use your left leg again to push yourself up, keeping your right foot on the bench all throughout.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <i>Rely the leg that's planted on the floor to do all the pushing and use your foot
                on the bench only for balance.</i></p>

    <!-- Seated Dumbbell Calf Raises -->
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Seated Dumbbell Calf Raises</h2>
        <p>Lastly, we'll be using two dumbbells and a bench again for this exercise. You'll will also need something
            like a board or platform to elevate your feet on.
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Sit on a bench and place both feet on a platform, your heels should be on the ground and your toes on
                top.</li>
            <li>Hold two dumbbells comfortably sit on your thighs just near your knee.</li>
            <li>Keeping your toes on the platform, raise your heels off the ground and hold that position for a second.
            </li>
            <li>Slowly lower your heels down and repeat until reps are completed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <i>You want to extend your foot as much as possible to get the most for your
